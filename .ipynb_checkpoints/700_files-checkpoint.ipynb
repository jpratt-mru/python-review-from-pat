    "# Data Files\n",
    "Two very common file formats used to store data are `.txt`(txt) and `.csv` (`Comman Separated Values`) files.\n",
    "- Both file types are just ASCII encoded **strings**\n",
    "    - neither includes formatting\n",
    "    - a `.csv` file is frequently opened and displayed with a spreadsheet while a `.txt.` file can be opened by a simple text editor like `Notepad`\n",
    "- the data is ***organized* by the programmer** when the file is exported by using symbols to delineate the data elements: `,` `;` `\\n` `\\t ` or a space  etc.\n",
    "    - Data in **one column of many rows** uses the `\\n` symbol to indicate a *new line*.\n",
    "    - Data in **one row of many columns** often uses a `,`\n",
    "- Data files can contain column or row labels, if the programmer chooses, but it is also reasonable to separate each set of data and **use self-documenting** file names.<br>\n",
    "    - When different data sets refer to different attributes of the same record, and thus are of the same length, they are often called **parallel files**.\n",
    "    -It behooves the programmer to export **clean** data files or they are obliged to deal with **dirty data** (empty trailing elements, missing elements, elements of unexpected / incorrect type) when they write code to import the data into lists.\n",
