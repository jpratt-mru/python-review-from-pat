    "# Decision (selection) Structures\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "To direct the **flow of control** in an algorithm into different solution paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "You can compare using the following comparison operators\n",
    " - `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `!=` `==` `in` `not in`\n",
    " - `not` `and` `or`\n",
    "     - `or` is inclusive: either condition being True is sufficient\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single\n",
    "\n",
    "With a default or common state, use just the if and true code block to deal with the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "![singleOutcome.png](singleOutcome.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "default = X\n",
    "if condition :\n",
    "    # True code block\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Double\n",
    "\n",
    "Most frequent type. Allows the code to branch into one of two (and never both) code blocks based on a condition. Note: `else` does **not** have a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "![doubleOutcome.png](doubleOutcome.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if (condition) :\n",
    "    # True code block\n",
    "else :\n",
    "    # False code block\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chained (case)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commonly used when conditions are based on a single variable that has an **ordered**\n",
    "\n",
    "![chained.png](chained.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if (condition 1) :\n",
    "    # Code block only if condition 1 is True\n",
    "elif (condition 2) :\n",
    "    # Code block only if condition 2 is True\n",
    "    \n",
    "# as many elif as you need\n",
    "\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code block only if all previous conditions False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested\n",
    "\n",
    "Any arrangement of the previous types can be created where a decision structure is located in a True or False code block (which then creates further indented and selected sub-code blocks).\n",
    "\n",
    "A nested selecction structure is good for distinguishing algorithm steps for independent outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![nested.png](nested.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "- Flowcharts are a great way to illustrate (and understand) algorithms with decisions when you **align your diamonds** and **are consistent with the direction of your *True/False* flow arrows**.\n",
    "- Recall, the number of outcomes is always 1 more than the minimum number of conditions. \n",
    "- Comparison operators happen after all arithmetic and are evaluated left to right.\n",
    "- Logical operators happen last, `not` before `and` before `or`\n",
    "- Logical operators are useful when each outcome does **not** need to be distinguished. Recall, `or` is inclusive so you can't know which condition was satisfied when it is evaulated\n",
    "- Recall this does **not** work\n",
    " \n",
    " ` if x <= 4 and <100` \n",
    " \n",
    " and while you can write conditions like\n",
    "\n",
    " `if 4<=x<100:`\n",
    " \n",
    " you are **strongly** discouraged from doing this...it only works in Python AND it can easily lead to miscommunication.\n",
    " \n",
    " Instead use\n",
    " \n",
    " `if x <= 4 and x < 100:`"

    "## Boolean Variables\n",
    "In some instances it makes sense to use a variable to capture 'Trueness' or 'Falseness'. \n",
    "Somethings to recall:\n",
    "- Boolean values are `True` `False`. Capitalization matters.\n",
    "- To test for a Boolean, do **not** compare it to `==True`. Instead\n",
    "```python\n",
    "youGetIt = True\n",
    "if youGetIt:\n",
    "    print(\"Nice\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Ask for help.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "### BTW:\n",
    "The above condition, testing for Boolean states, can be done on other variable types. There are rules you can look up, but examine the following examples and see if you work them out for yourself."
